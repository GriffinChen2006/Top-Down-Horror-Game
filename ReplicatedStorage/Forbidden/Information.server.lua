Known bugs:

	Modules can take up to 20 seconds to load in (noticable by shadows being updated visually; I believe it is a Roblox high graphics settings issue)
	
	Module loading in while facing attempted usage will brick any script without error codes, leading to confusion - solution, AI_Init_Time in precoded examples.
	
	Lock Icon not shown when player loads. (all functionality remains.) - Pets (not impl. yet)


Common Fixes:
	
	Restart Studio. Confirmed issue with Roblox Studio for many issues.
	
	
If none of the above works, send a comment, or a bug report in the discord, with the following information:
	
	>	Module used
	
	> 	Error (either quantative or qualitive)
	
	> 	Call to module
	
	> 	Example (optional)
	
	> 	Video	  (optional)
	
	> 	A possible way to replicate (optional)

UPDATE v0.0.18 - "The Big One"

	- AI 	| Rewritten for ideal concurrency handling and reliability.
			| Now, do not use ai.Stop if an immediate recall is imminent.
		
		>	Rewrote the concurrency handler (4 tiers of detection, {STATE, TOKEN, CALL_TIME, CONCURRENT_CALL_STATE})
		
		>	MoveToTargetRoot issue patched where the AI would run off to nowhere
		
		>	MoveToTargetRoot can now guess when the AI needs to jump, (only if AgentCanJump is true)
		
		>	If any of the waypoints skipped has a jump call, then the AI will jump.
		
	- ChaseAI
	
		>	Hooks added
		
		>	The core scripts of ChaseAI & ChaseAIWithHiding are now identical
		
		>	ChaseAIWithHiding can now be updated by only updating the actual script and leaving the hooks unless otherwise stated.
		
		>	ai.Stop's removed as the new AI module has optimal concurrency handling if they are.
	
	
	- Future
	
		>	Alternate targets support for ChaseAI (i.e. other NPCs).

	 *	"Actually looks like a script, and not c***kwired!" - @rman501
	
		>	Thank you for the play testers who helped once and for all solve the issues with the AI system and dependents
				- @RJCowles, @Fastboy_Gaming
			Check out the games I'm making with them, they will be on my channel (very bad games, but just to demonstrate Forbidden!)

	- AI

		otherwise, the delay in the event may mess up certain scripts (tracking, nextbots, etc...)	
				
			
			
UPDATE v0.0.6

	- AI.precoded.ChaseAI.ChaseAIWithHiding
	
		> 	A basic hiding system to get you started, implemented using the ChaseAIBase!

		>	AI.precoded - reduced network ownership api usage to reduce induced lag.
		
		
	- Major Bug Fixes
		>	AI.precoded.ChaseAI - NPC would sometimes nope out, and just turn around. Very complex ALLT solution (Anti Lock Lost Timing)
			Note: Awful, but it serves to protect against most problems

		%% note from present (0.0.12), this is solved.


UPDATE v0.0.5

	- AI.precoded.ChaseAI.ChaseAIBase
	
		> An example script with settings and functions to get you started.
			Yes the code is pretty difficult to read, yes it is my fault.
			Leave a comment in a video saying you want me to comment it and I will but the key functions are labeled
			for your use :). (please edit them, make it your own!)
			
			
	- AI.SmartPathfind
	
		> Fixed an issue where the waypoints would not delete unless Settings.Visualize was set to true. 


UPDATE v0.0.4

	- AI.SmartPathfind
	
		>	Added 'SwapMovementMethodDistance' setting: allows control of the distance at which the ai stops pathfinding and just tries to move to the player if its in LoS.
		
		>	If no path is available, the script now returns Enum.PathStatus.NoPath (only when Yield = true as no value is returned otherwise.)

		>	Added 'Tracking' setting
		
		>	Fixed major bug where two pathfinds would conflict
